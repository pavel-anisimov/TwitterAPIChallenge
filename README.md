# TwitterAPIChallenge
Coding Challenge for creating a Twitter API library connection. Written in NodeJS with Express.

Many companies are interested in making a front-end with standards-compliant, asyncronous, api-driven, 
beautious javascript. This task is to do just that with Twitter's REST api.

<strong>Frameworks and Languages: </strong>
Use any framework and languages you would like (evidence of native JavaScript use encouraged) to complete the task. 

<strong>Looking for:</strong><ul><li>Code quality</li><li>knowledge of cross-browser compatibility</li><li>quick load times</li><li>and innovation/thoughtfulness</li></ul>

<h2>Part I: Get API</h2>

<strong>Each tweet should include at minimum:</strong>
<ul><li>The tweet content</li>
<li>A well-formatted created_at date</li>
<li>A link to the tweet.</li>
<li>For retweets and mentions, the username should be included.</li></ul>

Please note that Twitter's REST api does not accept cross-domain requests. Feel free to use a simple proxy server, such asthis.

<h4>Bonuses/for fun:</h4>
: Make the columns flexible for screen width so the columns fill 100% of the page width. Layout could be as small as 320px wide. Column arrangment isopen-ended.


<h2>Part II: Meta</h2>

Make an "edit layout" view that has a form to change the layout settings.

Use HTML5 LocalStorage to store and load the layout settings.

<strong>Configurable settings could possibly include:</strong>
<ul><li>The order of the columns.</li>
<li>The time range of the tweets shown.</li>
<li>The number of tweets shown in each column.</li>
<li>The overall palette/skin of the page.</li>
<li>The "edit layout" panel can appear either on the same page as the tweets page, on its own page, or embedded within the tweets layout - whichever you would like. There should be a straightforward way to toggle between edit and view modes, and it should be clear to the user which mode they are currently in.</li></ul>
